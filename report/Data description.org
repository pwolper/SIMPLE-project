The SIMPLE model used in our experiments was applied to wheat data collected from five locations in the Cerrado region (Cerrado photo). These data are relevant parameters for running the SIMPLE model, including irrigation conditions (total amount of irrigation, cumulative irrigation days), soil components with four parameters characterizing soil properties (AWC, RCN, DDC, RZD), nine species of wheat Parameters (Tbase, Topt, RUE, I50maxH, I50maxW, MaxT, ExtremeT, CO2_RUE, S_Water). Specifically, the wheat variety used in our experiment is limited to one (BRS264), and there are four parameters to describe the characteristics of this variety (Tsum, HI, I50A, I50B). Finally, the data is applied to the model, and the predicted yield of wheat will be given.
For our experimental treatments, the average sowing and harvest dates across all 13 wheat fields were 20,293 and 20,416 days (not right!!! Should be calculated and transformed latter to specific date to consider), respectively. The soil type in the Ceraddo area is sandy loam. The crop data of the five locations to be simulated and predicted are unbalanced panel data (expressed as dummy variables) of different irrigation treatments in 2018-2019. Variety BRS264 is the most consumed and grown wheat in the Cerrado region over the past 10 years (#cite paper of BRS 264). This variety is still grown and promoted in Ceraddo thanks to its many positive characteristics of high tolerance to heat, pathogens, lodging and metal elements such as aluminum. In addition, some other environmental factors can also affect the cultivar performance of BRS264. BRS 264 is recommended to be planted in irrigation areas above 550m above sea level, and the best sowing dates are April 10 and May 31 (cite #paper 264 P9). Because during this period, mild and low temperature conditions can provide the best condition for the growth of cultivar. If the cultivar is sown early, the possibility of occurring blast between crops will increase under the influence of water supply. Last but not least, harvest date is also an important factor affecting yield quality. It is recommended to harvest the crop approximately 110 days after sowing.
