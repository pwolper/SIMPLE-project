#+title: Simulation of wheat yield in the Cerrado region of Southern Brazil using the SIMPLE crop model

* Introduction
 Testing: Cerrado is a biome in Brazil. The literature files can be found in the folder
* Data and Methods
** Experimental Data
** SIMPLE model
* Results
** Simulated experiments
Calibration of model with the obserevd data from the experiments. What locations worked well, which ones did not work so well? Results by groups?

** Climate change prediction
Results of the climate change prediction model using the climate scenarion from rogerio. Do the simulations.

* Discussion
