* Introduction
The Cerrado region of Brazil refers to the tropical savanna biomes that are widely distributed in the Eastern states of the country. Overall, the climate of Cerrado region is characterized by the semi humid tropical regimes that are dominated by wet and cold seasons annually. Conventionally, Brazil’s wheat production is dependent on the Southern regions of Brazil, contributing up to 91 % of national production in 2017. Although not considered a traditional region of cereal production, the Cerrado has become the target of agricultural expansion since the 1980s, due to its potential to grow wheat in the off-season from that of the Southern regions. Hence, the incentivization of the Cerrado in crop production is considered a lucrative development in the region, partitioning approximately 44% of its total area to farmland. However, Brazil’s agroeconomic reliance on such expansions may highlight the increasing vulnerability to climate change, which could destabilize crop production in the fulfilment of domestic food demand.

here is where the second paragraph goes...

* Data and Methods
** Experimental Data
Information about experimental set ups. Water managment? Nitrogen (eventhough not used in the SIMPLE model). Average sowing and harvest date. Information on the cultivar BRS264?

** SIMPLE model

* Results
** Simulated experiments
In order to assess the capabilities of the SIMPLE model to model wheat growth in the Cerrado region, we simulated yield for 13 field trials in 5 different locations. Irrigated location where simulated with no water stress, implying a perfect watering routine. Nonirrigated crops had water stress turned on and relied only on rainfalls, supplied in the weather data. Since no nutrients are simulated in the SIMPLE model, we assume perfect nutrient saturation of the crops, a state not uncommon for field trials. The atmospheric CO2 concentration was set to 415 ppm, reflecting the current value as of 2020. Soil parameters were estimated from the content of Silt, Clay and Sand found in typical Cerrado soils (*cite soils*)

The species and cultivar parameters required by the SIMPLE mode were derived from literature or estimated based on similar species. (*cite zhao et al.*) Further calibration was done by adjusting cultivar parameters (Tsum, I50A, I50B and HI) within reasonable levels.

(insert table here.)

The results of the simulation across experiments are shown in (Figure calibration). The model has an accuracy of:

These results indicate that in many cases there is significant deviation between the simulated and observed yield. While several experiments are simulated with decent accuracy, a general trend of the simulation to overestimating the observed yield can be observed. Due to the simple nature of the model this is to be expected, since in reality there are many more yield-limiting factors, such as nutrients, that the SIMPLE model does not account for.
We also observe that the accuracy of predicting yield varies between locations, as can  be expected between differing environments. It can be seen, that experiments conducted in Vicosa, MG have the best simulated results of all 5 locations. On the other hand, specifically the nonirrigated field trials in Sao Gotardo, which also have been inoculated with a fungal pathogen, show a bad fit between simulated and observed yield, by grossly overestimating the yield in the simulation. This discrepancy is likely caused by the fungal pathogen having a negative effect on the yield, which is not accounted for by the model.

Summary statistics decribing the accuracy are done for all experiments, as well as subgroups of the data. These can be seen in [[stats]] and include all the experiments (All), excluding the nonirrigated trials in Sao Gotardo, where the plants where infected with the blast fungus (healthy) and statistics of only the trials in Vicosa (Vicosa), where the model performed the most accurately.

** Climate change prediction
As the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) released by humans and their societies predicted to further increase during the second half of the century it, it's impact on agriculture is important for maintaining food security during a changing climate. As it is the most common GHG emitted by humans and contributes greatly to global warming the levels of CO_{2} in the atmosphere have been subject to much predictive modeling. According to the latest IPCC (*cite*) report, by the end of the 21st Century the concentration of CO_{2} in the atmosphere is predicteed to increase to levels anywhere between 400 ppm to 1100 ppm. While the lower limit of this prediction depends on the most favorable scietal drivers involving drastic reductions in emission very rapidly, the upper limits assumes the most detrimental course of society, involving little to no climate action. While both of these szenarios are considered unlikely, mean CO_{2}-concentration in the atmosphere is still likely to increase by roughly 50% under realistic szenarios.

In order to simulate the effect of increasing atmospheric CO_{2} concentrations on wheat yield in the brazilian Cerrado, we will assume a linear increase of CO_{2} and reaches 795 ppm by the year 2100. Because our simulation starts in the year 2030, we have choose an appropriate concentration of 450 ppm as a starting value, and assume an increase by 5 ppm.
