#+title: Simulation of wheat yield in the Cerrado region of Southern Brazil using the SIMPLE crop model

* Introduction
 Testing: Cerrado is a biome in Brazil. The literature files can be found in the folder.
* Data and Methods
Description of the data to go here. Which locations where used?  What where the conditions? Fungal inoculations? How can we sort the data. By locations? Show the map.
* Results
** Simulated experiments
Calibration of model with the obserevd data from the experiments. What locations worked well, which ones did not work so well? Results by groups?

** Climate change prediction
Results of the climate change prediction model using the climate scenarion from rogerio. Do the simulations.

* Discussion
