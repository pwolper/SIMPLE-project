#+title: Simulation of wheat yield in the Cerrado region of Southern Brazil using the SIMPLE crop model

* Introduction
 Testing: Cerrado is a biome in Brazil. The literature files can be found in the folder

* Data and Methods
** Experimental Data
Information about experimental set ups. Water managment? Nitrogen (eventhough not used in the SIMPLE model). Average sowing and harvest date. Information on the cultivar BRS264?

** SIMPLE model

* Results
** Simulated experiments
The SIMPLE model was calibrated by simulating the yield of 13 different field experiments conducted between 2018 and 2022 in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The average


Calibration of model with the obserevd data from the experiments. What locations worked well, which ones did not work so well? Results by groups? What was done during calibration?

** Climate change prediction
Work out results for climate change data simulations. Depending on how much time we have.

* Discussion
