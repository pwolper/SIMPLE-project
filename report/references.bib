@incollection{lopes-2016-chapt-one,
  abstract =     {The rise of agriculture production in the Brazilian savanna is
                  seen as one of the greatest achievements of worldwide
                  agricultural science in the 20th century. Yet, reaching this
                  current situation was, and still is, not an easy task.
                  Actually, until the 1960s, 23 \% of Brazil (2million km2) was
                  occupied by a savanna-like vegetation generally called
                  "Cerrado," developed in highly weathered soils, with
                  particularly low natural fertility, used for extensive beef
                  cattle production on unimproved pastures. This review paper
                  intends to summarize a pioneer survey study by Dr Alfredo
                  Lopes on "Cerrado" soils in the mid-1970s aiming to: (1)
                  revisit the main chemical and physical properties of 518
                  topsoil samples under "Cerrado" vegetation in Central Brazil;
                  (2) compare these results with some of the critical levels
                  suggested for soil fertility interpretation; and, (3) study
                  some relations among soil physical, chemical, and
                  mineralogical characteristics in selected 44 topsoil samples
                  with data concerning available water, phosphorus fixation,
                  charge attributes, as well as extractable and total zinc.
                  Besides stressing on the importance of adequate management
                  strategies to allow the incorporation of these low natural
                  fertility soils into successful crop production, we also
                  highlight the historical importance of international
                  collaborations that contribute to the development of soil
                  fertility evaluation and agronomic-economic research programs
                  on tropical soils in the Brazilian Cerrados. Lastly,
                  additional comments are provided concerning the need of
                  strategic actions and appropriate political decisions for the
                  continuous sustainable development of this region.},
