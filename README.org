#+title: Project Outline

* Organization
1. Organization (Run SIMPLE)
2. Calibration (stats) --> *plots*
3. (Validation (stats) --> *plots*) WE CAN SKIP THIS STEP.
5. Application --> *plots*

* Data
_Data necessary to run the SIMPLE model:_
- weather (download from NASA)
- soil (supplied)
- crop management (supplied)

** Experimental Data
-> calibration for this data. Cultivar and species parameters (adjust in respective order)
Optimal conditions (no disease, pest, nutrient deficiency)

** Farmer's Data
Validation of the model. Origin of the yield gap.

** Application Data
relevant data to run the simple model in a chosen condition and context of a hypothesis.

* Wheat Infos
Simulate wheat in Cerrado. How much wheat do we really get?
Download weather data from NASA power.
Experiment provided by Rogerio.
Application to climatic scenarios from IPCC. WHat happens with the wheat yield.
